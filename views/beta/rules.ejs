  <li><strong>PLAY</strong> The following shall govern play in League matches:
    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
      <li>Each team in the League shall play home and away matches
        with every other team in the Division.</li>
      <li>Each match shall be played by teams consisting of Three Ladies
        and Three Gentlemen, who shall play Three Ladies' Doubles,
        Three Gent's Doubles and Three Mixed Doubles. The players
        for all level Doubles shall be ranked in order of playing ability.
        The couples for Mixed Doubles games shall be ranked in order
        of mixed playing strength; the order of play in these games shall
        be declared on the Official Score Sheet by the opposing Captains
        before play commences. The nine couples so formed shall play
        two games of 21 aces against the couples of equal rank in the
        opposing team.</li>
      <li>Matches shall commence at the time stated in the handbook or
        at a time mutually agreed by the captains of the 2 teams. The
        order of play shall be as set out on the official score sheet. If
        either team does not have gents 1 & 2 ready for play 15 minutes
        from the scheduled agreed time that team shall forfeit the 1st
        game, if after a further 15 minutes gents 1 & 2 are still unavailable
        the second game is forfeited. Following the scheduled or agreed
        start time, players must be present and ready for play in
        subsequent games assuming an elapsed time of 15 minutes per
        game per available court. From a scheduled pair of games
        between opposing pairs, if a pair only claims the first game due
        to the non-availability of the opposition, then when playing the
        remaining game, that pair will have choice of ends, with the
        option to serve being determined in an agreed manner.
        If the order of play is changed to accommodate the late arrival
        of player/s and all possible games have been played, from the
        12 level doubles any remaining games that are unplayable shall
        be claimed at this time. If players are unavailable from both
        teams,then unplayed games are void and no points are awarded
        to either side.
        If a player fails to turn up, then the mixed doubles must still be
        played in order of precedence and the match card may be
        amended. For example MX D1 cannot be conceded for an
        unavailable player if MX D2 an MX D3 are played.</li>
      <li>Any club unable to provide a full team will forfeit, to the opposition
        all games not played. Rule 13b still applies and all eligible
        players must be entered on the match card and play in order of
        strength, number 1 down to number 3. If unable to field a full
        team, every effort must be made to notify the opposition as far
        in advance as possible, by phone. For any teams fielding fewer
        than 5 players the following penalties may apply at the discretion
        of the Committee. Fielding 4 players a penalty of 2 points,
        fielding 3 players a penalty of 4 points, fielding 2 players a
        penalty of 6 points and for less than 2 players a penalty of 10
        points.</li>
      <li>Generally the conduct of the game will be in the hands of the
        players. However, an umpire will be appointed alternatively by
        each side (home team first) who will:</li>
      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
        <li>keep the score</li>
        <li>rule on any dispute which may arise during play.
          The umpire's ruling will be final.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>All matches will consist of 18 games as per Rule 13b. Each game
        will win one point. The League Table order will be dictated by the
        total number of games won.</li>
      <li>Visiting teams shall abide by the playing rules and byelaws of the
        home Club providing these do not contravene the Rules of the
        League, and it shall be incumbent upon the home players to
        declare to the visitors before the match such rules or byelaws
        which are likely to affect play.</li>
      <li>All disputes or appeals on any matter shall be submitted in
        writing or by e-mail within seven days of the event to the
        Executive Committee through the League Secretary.</li>
      <li>Clothing worn on court must be recognised badminton sports
        clothing. Any player contravening this rule will be reported and
        liable to disciplinary action.</li>
      <li>No player is allowed to play in two different matches at the same time.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  <li><strong>FIXTURES</strong> Matches shall be played as set out in the official
    League Fixture lists. No match shall be rearranged unless the
    room of the home team becomes unavailable OR with the
    agreement of both Captains, the Results Secretary to be notified
    immediately by both the home and away teams of any such
    changes. <strong style="text-decoration:underline">Failure to do so within 7 days of the original date
      will result in a fine of ten pounds (£10).</strong> Any team unable to
    fulfil a fixture will score no points, but the team conceded to will
    score 18 points. A team which does not turn up for a match fixture
    on more than one occasion and cannot satisfy the League
    Executive Committee that there is a very good reason, shall be
    placed at the bottom of their division for relegation at the end of
    the season. All match results during the season with that team
    are to be disregarded when it comes to deciding the promotion
    and relegation positions. All fixtures to be completed by the end
    of April, or at the discretion of the Results Secretary.
    Match results shall be submitted on the official score sheet by
    the home team so as to reach the Results Secretary within seven
    days of the match in question having been played. <strong style="text-decoration:underline">Teams not
    complying with this rule shall, on submission of the 2nd and
    subsequent late score sheets, be fined £10. For the 3rd and
    subsequent late score sheets all points scored by the home
    team in those matches will be forfeited.</strong>
    Clubs with more than one team in any division must play all
    matches between these teams before 30th November in any
    season.</li>

    or more teams, their positions in the League shall be decided in
    alphabetical order. In the FINAL LEAGUE TABLE in the event
    of the total number of points being equal, the placings shall be
    decided only by the results of the matches played between the
    teams concerned. The teams will be placed in order of the
    games won against each other and where these are equal, by
    the differences in aces scored, for and against.</li>
  <li><strong>PROMOTION & RELEGATION</strong> The two teams finishing top of
    any division shall normally be promoted to a higher division.
    The two teams finishing bottom of any division shall normally be
    relegated to the next lower division. If the number of teams in a
    division is to be increased, then the relative playing strengths of
    the teams that would normally be relegated and the teams
    finishing outside of the automatic promotion places of the
    division below, shall be compared. The assessed stronger
    teams shall then be placed in the restructured division. If, after
    the agreed formation of divisions for the season, a team is
    withdrawn or has its playing record voided, that team shall be
    considered to have finished bottom of the division and fill an
    automatic relegation position.</li>
  <li><strong>COURTS</strong> It shall be incumbent upon the home team to have all
    lines clearly marked before each match commences and to see
    the net is in a good state of repair. In marking out the court the
    measurements laid down by the Laws of Badminton shall be
    used. If this is impossible, a close approximation should be
    attempted.</li>
  <li><strong>REGISTRATION OF PLAYERS</strong> Each club must register with
    the Results Secretary any player likely to be called upon to play
    for the Club in any League match.

        according to their standard. Failure to comply with the spirit
        of this law may result in the deduction of points.</li>
      <li>If there is a re-selection, the Results Secretary shall be
        informed of the names of the players promoted and demoted
        and these changes shall stand for a period of not less than
        3 league matches.</li>
      <li>The Executive Committee have the right to regulate the
        interchange of players between teams and the use of
        reserves in the interest of fair competition.</li>
